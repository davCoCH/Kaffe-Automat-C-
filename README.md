Project Description: Kaffe Automat

This project, developed during my time at the technical school for software development, is a simulation of a coffee vending machine written in C++. The program, titled Kaffe Automat, aims to provide an interactive experience for selecting, purchasing, and virtually preparing various coffee options.  

Key Features:

1. Product Selection:  
   - Users can choose from an initial variety of six coffee types, including options like "Kaffee Schwarz" (Black Coffee) and "Latte Macchiato Intenso".  
   - Selection is made by entering the corresponding product code number.  

2. Customization Options:  
   - The program asks whether the customer wants to add sugar to the coffee, with an additional cost of 0.20 CHF per portion.  
   - Users must specify the amount of sugar by entering numerical values.  

3. Payment Management:  
   - A system is implemented to process payments using coins (CHF).  
   - The program verifies the inserted amount, calculates change if overpaid, or prompts the user to insert the remaining amount if underpaid.  

4. Order Confirmation and Updates:  
   - Customers are kept informed about the status of their order throughout the process.  
   - The program formats prices and changes appropriately, displaying them in CHF currency.  

5. Interactive Error Handling:  
   - Incorrect inputs, such as invalid product codes or sugar options, are handled with prompts to retry.  
   - Users can cancel the operation at any time by pressing the "C" key.  

6. Future Expansion:  
   - The program is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the addition of new coffee products and features.  

This project showcases the use of structured programming principles in C++, including the use of structs for product modeling, vector-based data handling, and interactive console-based user interfaces. It demonstrates practical skills in user input validation, payment logic, and process management.
